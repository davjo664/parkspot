# Parkspot App

## Parkspot App Distribution
### Installation

 Provide your email address and whether you want to use iOS or Android to Jonas Graf (jg115@hdm-stuttgart.de) and you will be added to the group for Android or iOS.

 For iOS: you also have to provide your Device UUID. (How to find your UUID: https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev93ef696c6?sub=devca47eaad4) to be able install the app.

 You will now receive an email with the installation link and further help from Appcenter each new release. (Note you have to register at appcenter.ms during the installation process.)

### Versioning
The app uses the version set in the `package.json`. To update this use `npm version major.minor.patch`, e.g. `npm version 1.5.3`.

### Distribution
Updates containing native changes are made via a new release in Appcenter. Changes in the JavaScript can be released via the appcenter-cli (`npm install -g appcenter-cli`). Then run 
`apcenter login`

Distribution during the development is made using VS Appcenter (appcenter.ms). It consists of 2 parts 1. the native App 2. the JavaScript content.

#### Full
To fully deploy a new version of the app, you can use `yarn ios-deploy` for iOS and `yarn android-deploy` for Android. 

#### JavaScript Update
Use `yarn android-deploy-codepush` for Android or `yarn ios-deploy-codepush` for iOS to deploy JavaScript updates.

#### Build and Archive app
For the iOS App you have to run `yarn ios-deploy` on a Mac with XCode and the XCode CLI installed. After quite some time, you can find the app (.ipa) under `app/build/`.
for the Android App you have to run `yarn android-deploy-build`. You can then find the app under `app/build/outputs/apk/release`.

#### Uploading
To upload the built and archived apps you have to run `yarn ios-deploy-upload` and `yarn android-deploy-upload`.

Based on:

* [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)
* [NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/)
* [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/)
* [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)
* Using [Flow](https://flow.org/) as type checker


## Get Started Development
