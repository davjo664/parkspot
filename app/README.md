#Parkspot App

## Parkspot App Distribution
### Installation

 Provide your mail adress and whether you want to use ios or android to Jonas Graf (jg115@hdm-stuttgart.de) and you will be added to the group for Android or iOS.

 For iOS: you also have to provide your Device UUID. (How to find your UUID: https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev93ef696c6?sub=devca47eaad4) to be able install the app.

 You will now receive an e-mail with the installation link and further help from Appcenter each new release. (Note you have to register at appcenter.ms during the installation process.)


### Development
Distribution during the development is made using VS Appencenter (appcenter.ms). It consits of 2 parts 1. the native App 2. the Javascript content.

Updates containing native changes are made via a new release in Appcenter. Changes in the Javascript can be released via the appcenter-cli (`npm install -g appcenter-cli`). Then run 
`apcenter login` and  
` appcenter codepush release-react -a jnsfrg/parkspot` for ios and ` appcenter codepush release-react -a jnsfrg/parkspot-android` for android.

The codepush and native release should be done for all major merges into the Master.

To release an ios App you have to build the `.ipa` File via Xcode -> Product > Archive. Then go to Window > Organizer and Export the App for Development. Therefore you need to be in the University Apple Dev Programm and sign the app. Note: All Devices you want to run the App on needs to be registered first. Complete guide: https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev7ccaf4d3c
You can then upload the file to Appcenter in the parkspot project. *(We can just aggree on Jonas uploading the App as this is a bit of work to go through at first.)*

To release an Android App you have to build the signed `.apk` file. As a Keystore is provided and configured in the repository you can simply run `cd android && ./gradlew assembleRelease`. You can then find the app under `app/releases` and upload it to Appcenter.


## Parkspot App Development

Template: for now containing a Button that calls the API on http://localhost:3000/parkspot to get the List of Parkspots an displaying the Count of Parkspots

Based on:

* [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)
* [NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/)
* [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/)
* [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)
* Using [Flow](https://flow.org/) as type checker


## Get Started Development

### 1. System Requirements

* Globally installed [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)

* Globally installed [react-native CLI](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) setup for your iOS / Android on your OS
* [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/)

### 2. Installation

On the command prompt run the following commands

```sh
$ cd parkspot/app

$ npm install
  or
  yarn
```

For iOS:

```sh
$ cd parkspot/app/ios

$ pod install
```

If you want open the Xcode Project then use the .xcworkspace file instead of the project file.

#### Run on iOS

* Run `npm run ios` in your terminal

#### Run on Android

* Run `npm run android` in your terminal
